# Stock_price_prediction
This machine learning project leverages advanced predictive models to forecast stock prices and analyze their fluctuations based on specific market parameters. By utilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Support Vector Machines for Regression (SVM-SVR), and the TensorFlow framework, the project integrates deep learning and traditional machine learning techniques to create accurate and adaptive predictions. LSTM networks are used to model time-series data, capturing long-term dependencies and trends in stock prices, while SVM-SVR helps in creating robust regression models for short-term predictions. The TensorFlow framework enables efficient training and deployment of these models, ensuring scalability and performance. This combination of methods provides a comprehensive approach to predicting market behavior, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of price movements influenced by historical data, economic factors, and other key variables.
